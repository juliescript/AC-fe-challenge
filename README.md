# AskCharlie Coding Challenge

## Assumptions:

- JSON file should be read from an internal URL which is to be replaced by a real URL once the backend is up and running
- CSS should be done with Bootstrap classes to make browser compatibility less of a hassle for a prototype
- DO NOT edit on the original file so that there is data to be read
- Services and classes should be together on the "shared" folder inside the app

## Nice to haves:
- It would be nice to create a Node.JS based backend using LoopBack and FireBase
- Some actual design would be nice, as I'm no UX expert, I left the whole thing as clean as possible

## What I used to build this project

- [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 1.0.0-beta.15.
- [Bootstrap 3](http://getbootstrap.com)
- [moment.js](http://momentjs.com)

## To run this project

You will need to install `angular-cli`, to do that you just need to:
- `npm i -g angular-cli@latest`
- `git clone https://github.com/juliettemaxwell/AC-fe-challenge.git`
- Navigate to created directory
- `npm install`
- Once the installation is done, just run `ng serve`

## To run unit test

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Final notes

Thank you so much for taking your time to review my code. I will be looking forward for whichever feedback you can give me. 

Cheers!
